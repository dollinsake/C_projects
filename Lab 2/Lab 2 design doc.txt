Which in turn returns the record, name, and ID number.Second function:printNumOfRecords() Just goes through and prints the number of recordsThird functionVoid sizeOfDb()using the built in function sizeof we check the size struct then multiply it by the number of records the print of size.Fourth addRecord():First off had to intiliazie the idIntry, create a enough memory for the nameEntry then initialize a dbsize by using sizeof(struct person) and multiplying by the number of records. After that a while loop was created to keep adding in entries to the DB so long as the name isn’t invalid.Fifth autoAddRecords():I just created an auto add where I just filled in the database with entries I created.Delete Record ():goes through and deletes the records from the db then creates a memory copy of the oldDB along with its size and frees up space for the oldDBprintNumofAccess():Goes through and says how many times the DB was accessed.Main(): The main method basically just has all the options that the user can choose from to manipulate the data. There is a switch statement to make things more efficient with choosing how things will be added into the database.
